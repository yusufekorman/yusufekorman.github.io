## Code Analysis
In this writeup, I'll analyze a SQL injection vulnerability discovered in the `sanitizeInput` function.

### Initial Analysis
The code contains several key components:
1. An input sanitization function
2. String conversion to lowercase
3. Blacklist filtering mechanism

### The Vulnerability
After reviewing the code, I identified the following issues:

- The function converts input to lowercase and stores it in `lowercase` variable
- A `blacklist` array contains prohibited SQL keywords/patterns
- The filter replaces matches from the `blacklist` with empty strings
- **Critical Bug**: Filter uses `input` variable instead of `lowercase` for replacements

### Exploitation
The vulnerability allows bypass of the blacklist by using uppercase characters:

Original payload:
`' UNION SELECT 1,2,3... FROM users WHERE '1'='1`
`https://example.com/?query=some&s=%27%20UNION%20SELECT%201%2C2%2C3%20FROM%20users%20WHERE%20%271%27%3D%271`
